# COM661FullStackBackendAPI

The goal of this assignment was to create a full stack application. Therefore, I decided to developed a movie review webpage.
The code base is split up into two code bases COM661_FULL_STACK_FRONTEND_ANGULAR and COM661_FULL_STACK_BACKEND_API.

* The images below are not a complete outline of the system. This just provides a highlevel overview of the system.
